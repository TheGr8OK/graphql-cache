**NOTE: this project is looking for maintainers.** If you need caching to work for newer versions of graphql-ruby or for connection types, you may want to have a look at the [graphql-fragment_cache](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/graphql-ruby-fragment_cache) gem.

# GraphQL Cache
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/graphql-cache.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/graphql-cache) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stackshareio/graphql-cache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stackshareio/graphql-cache) [![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/524c0f23ed1dbf0f9338/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/stackshareio/graphql-cache/test_coverage) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/524c0f23ed1dbf0f9338/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/stackshareio/graphql-cache/maintainability) [![Stack Share](https://img.shields.io/badge/tech-stack-0690fa.svg?style=flat)](https://stackshare.io/stackshare/graphql-cache)

A modern, compatible caching plugin for [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) supporting both GraphQL 1.x and 2.x

## 🚀 Version 1.0.0 - Modernized for GraphQL-Ruby 2.x

This version has been completely modernized to support the latest GraphQL-Ruby versions while maintaining backward compatibility with 1.x applications.

### ✅ What's New
- **GraphQL-Ruby 2.x Support**: Uses new field extensions instead of deprecated field instrumentation
- **Backward Compatible**: Seamlessly works with GraphQL-Ruby 1.8+ through 2.5+
- **Smart Object Cleaning**: Automatically handles non-serializable objects (Procs, Methods) in cached data
- **Improved Connection Handling**: Supports both GraphQL 1.x and 2.x connection types
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for serialization issues

### 📋 Version Compatibility

| GraphQL-Ruby Version | graphql-cache Version | Status |
|---------------------|----------------------|--------|
| 2.0.0 - 2.5.x      | 1.0.0+              | ✅ Fully Supported (Extensions) |
| 1.12.0 - 1.13.x    | 1.0.0+              | ✅ Fully Supported (Instrumentation) |
| 1.8.0 - 1.11.x     | 1.0.0+              | ✅ Fully Supported (Instrumentation) |
| < 1.8.0             | 0.6.1               | ⚠️ Legacy Support Only |

## Goals

- Provide resolver-level caching for [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) APIs written in ruby
- Configurable to work with or without Rails
- Modern compatibility with GraphQL-Ruby 1.x and 2.x
- Intelligent handling of complex objects and serialization edge cases
- [API Documentation](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/graphql-cache)

## Why?

At [StackShare](https://stackshare.io) we've been rolling out [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) for several of our new features and found ourselves in need of a caching solution. We could have simply used `Rails.cache` in our resolvers, but this creates very verbose types or resolver classes. It also means that each and every resolver must define its own expiration and key. GraphQL Cache solves that problem by integrating caching functionality into the [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) resolution process making caching transparent on most fields except for a metadata flag denoting the field as cached. More details on our motivation for creating this [here](https://stackshare.io/posts/introducing-graphql-cache).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphql-cache'
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
$ gem install graphql-cache
```

## Setup

### For GraphQL-Ruby 2.x (Recommended)

1. Use GraphQL Cache as a plugin in your schema:

```ruby
class MySchema < GraphQL::Schema
  query Types::Query

  use GraphQL::Cache
end
```

2. Add the custom caching field class to your base object class:

```ruby
module Types
  class Base < GraphQL::Schema::Object
    field_class GraphQL::Cache::Field
  end
end
```

### For GraphQL-Ruby 1.x (Legacy)

The setup is identical to 2.x - the gem automatically detects your GraphQL-Ruby version and uses the appropriate caching mechanism (field extensions for 2.x, field instrumentation for 1.x).

_Note: If you want access to the `cache` keyword param in interface fields, the field_class directive must be added to your base interface module as well._

## Configuration

GraphQL Cache can be configured in an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/graphql_cache.rb

GraphQL::Cache.configure do |config|
  config.namespace = 'GraphQL::Cache' # Cache key prefix for keys generated by graphql-cache
  config.cache     = Rails.cache      # The cache object to use for caching
  config.logger    = Rails.logger     # Logger to receive cache-related log messages
  config.expiry    = 5400             # 90 minutes (in seconds)
end
```

## Usage

Any object, list, or connection field can be cached by simply adding `cache: true` to the field definition:

```ruby
field :calculated_field, Int, cache: true
field :expensive_query, [Types::MyType], cache: true
field :connection_field, Types::MyType.connection_type, cache: true
```

### Custom Expirations

By default all keys will have an expiration of `GraphQL::Cache.expiry` which defaults to 90 minutes. If you want to set a field-specific expiration time pass a hash to the `cache` parameter like this:

```ruby
field :calculated_field, Int, cache: { expiry: 10800 } # expires key after 180 minutes
```

### Custom cache keys

GraphQL Cache generates a cache key using the context of a query during execution. A custom key can be included to implement versioned caching as well. By providing a `:key` value to the cache config hash on a field definition. For example, to use a custom method that returns the cache key for an object use:

```ruby
field :calculated_field, Int, cache: { key: :custom_cache_key }
```

With this configuration the cache key used for this resolved value will use the result of the method `custom_cache_key` called on the parent object.

### Forcing the cache

It is possible to force graphql-cache to resolve and write all cached fields to cache regardless of the presence of a given key in the cache store. This will effectively "renew" any existing cached expirations and warm any that don't exist. To use forced caching, add a value to `:force_cache` in the query context:

```ruby
MySchema.execute('{ company(id: 123) { cachedField }}', context: { force_cache: true })
```

This will resolve all cached fields using the field's resolver and write them to cache without first reading the value at their respective cache keys. This is useful for structured cache warming strategies where the cache expiration needs to be updated when a warming query is made.

## 🛡️ Object Serialization & Limitations

GraphQL Cache automatically handles complex object serialization to ensure reliable caching. Here's what you need to know:

### ✅ Supported Objects

**Basic Types:**
```ruby
field :string_field, String, cache: true      # ✅ Strings
field :integer_field, Int, cache: true        # ✅ Integers  
field :float_field, Float, cache: true        # ✅ Floats
field :boolean_field, Boolean, cache: true    # ✅ Booleans
field :array_field, [String], cache: true     # ✅ Arrays
field :hash_field, GraphQL::Types::JSON, cache: true # ✅ Hashes
```

**ActiveRecord Objects:**
```ruby
field :user, Types::UserType, cache: true              # ✅ Single AR objects
field :users, [Types::UserType], cache: true           # ✅ AR collections
field :user_connection, Types::UserType.connection_type, cache: true # ✅ Connections
```

**GraphQL Objects:**
```ruby
field :custom_object, Types::MyCustomType, cache: true # ✅ Custom GraphQL types
field :interface_field, Types::MyInterface, cache: true # ✅ Interface types
```

### ⚠️ Automatically Cleaned Objects

The gem automatically cleans these objects to make them cacheable:

**Non-Serializable Callables:**
```ruby
# These are automatically replaced with nil during caching
field :field_with_proc, String, cache: true do
  # Procs in resolved data are cleaned out
end
```

**ActiveRecord with Associations Containing Procs:**
```ruby
# The gem extracts core attributes and IDs, removing problematic associations
field :user_with_complex_data, Types::UserType, cache: true
```

### ❌ Limitations & Unsupported Objects

**File Objects:**
```ruby
field :file_field, String, cache: false # ❌ File objects cannot be marshaled
# Use cache: false or implement custom serialization
```

**External API Clients:**
```ruby
field :api_client, String, cache: false # ❌ HTTP clients, API connections
# Cache the result data, not the client object
```

**Database Connections:**
```ruby
field :db_connection, String, cache: false # ❌ Database connection objects
# Cache query results, not connection objects
```

### 🔧 Best Practices

**1. Cache Results, Not Clients:**
```ruby
# ❌ Don't cache the client
field :api_data, String, cache: true do
  external_api_client.fetch_data # Client gets cached (problematic)
end

# ✅ Cache the result
field :api_data, String, cache: true do
  result = external_api_client.fetch_data
  result.to_json # Only cache serializable data
end
```

**2. Use Custom Keys for Complex Objects:**
```ruby
field :complex_calculation, Float, cache: { key: :calculation_cache_key }

def calculation_cache_key
  "calc_#{updated_at.to_i}_#{some_dependent_value}"
end
```

**3. Handle Large Objects:**
```ruby
# For very large objects, consider caching subsets
field :large_dataset, [Types::DataType], cache: { expiry: 3600 } do
  # Cache expires sooner for large datasets
end
```

## 🔍 Debugging & Monitoring

### Cache Logging

Enable detailed cache logging in your configuration:

```ruby
GraphQL::Cache.configure do |config|
  config.logger = Rails.logger
  # Set log level to debug to see cache hits/misses
end
```

**Log Output Examples:**
```
DEBUG -- : Cache miss: (GraphQL::Cache:User:123:calculated_field:abc123)
DEBUG -- : Cache hit: (GraphQL::Cache:User:123:calculated_field:abc123)  
DEBUG -- : Cache write successful after cleaning: (GraphQL::Cache:User:123:complex_field:def456)
DEBUG -- : Cache skip: (GraphQL::Cache:User:123:problematic_field:ghi789) - failed to serialize even after cleaning
```

### Performance Monitoring

Track cache effectiveness in your application:

```ruby
# In your GraphQL context
context = {
  cache_stats: { hits: 0, misses: 0 }
}

# The gem will populate these stats during execution
MySchema.execute(query, context: context)
puts "Cache hits: #{context[:cache_stats][:hits]}"
puts "Cache misses: #{context[:cache_stats][:misses]}"
```

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### From 0.6.x to 1.0.0

No breaking changes! The new version is fully backward compatible:

1. Update your Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'graphql-cache', '~> 1.0'
```

2. Run bundle update:
```sh
bundle update graphql-cache
```

3. (Optional) For GraphQL-Ruby 2.x users, you can remove field instrumentation warnings by ensuring you're using the latest schema definition format.

### Migrating from graphql-fragment_cache

If you're migrating from the fragment_cache gem:

```ruby
# Before (fragment_cache)
field :expensive_field, String do
  extension GraphQL::FragmentCache::ObjectCacheExtension, cache_key: :cache_key
end

# After (graphql-cache)  
field :expensive_field, String, cache: { key: :cache_key }
```

## 🧪 Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

**Testing with Different GraphQL Versions:**
```sh
# Test with GraphQL 1.x
bundle exec appraisal graphql-1-13 rspec

# Test with GraphQL 2.x  
bundle exec appraisal graphql-2-0 rspec
```

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
